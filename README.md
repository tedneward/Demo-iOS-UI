# Demo: iOS UI
This is a repository containing several applications that serve as demos for how to do various things with the user interface in an iOS application.

## ControlSink
Demonstrates a number of the different iOS controls.

## NibLoadingDemo
Demonstrates how to create an application screen using Nibs (aka 'xib' files).

## PinchZoom
Demonstrates how to use gesture recognizers in iOS--each of the different kind of gesture recognizers is instantiated and registered with the main view, but in order to make it clear which one is being triggered, it displays some "debug text" at the bottom.

## Pickers
Demonstrates how to use a standard Date picker as well as how to create a custom picker, which displays one of many options (colleges, in this case).
